[notes]

- There wasn't a standard test/train split so we created one using the Python
  script stratified_split.py.
- There was one mention of a "newspaper" entity; this was removed.
- The corpus was hand-annotated by students.
- The entity types were inspired by Ontonotes but diverge a bit; the entities
  which differ are related according to the following:

    GUM             ONTONOTES
    -------------------------
    place           GPE, LOC, FAC
    organization    NORP, ORG
    object          PRODUCT, WORK_OF_ART, and any other concrete objects
    time            DAT, TIM
    abstract        LANGUAGE, LAW, and all other abstractions
    quantity        PCT, MON, and all other quantities

    ORDINAL and CARDINAL were not annotated at all.
