Due to licensing restrictions, the BBN Pronoun Coreference and Entity Type
Corpus cannot be distributed. It can be obtained from the LDC.

However, we included a script that will convert the dataset into CONLL 2003
format.

1. Put the contents of the BBN dataset (available from LDC, catalog
number LDC2005T33), in this directory.

2. Create directory data within CONLL-format

3. Some minor cleaning must be done (some XML errors). See BBN/README.rst
   for the details.

4. Then, in directory utils, in Python 2:

from bbn2conll import *
write_all_to_conll()

This will write the BBN corpus into CONLL-formatted files in the directory
CONLL-format/data/
