The MalwareTextDB Dataset
=========================

This dataset consists of texts about malware. It was developed by researchers
at the Singapore University of Technology and Design and
DSO National Laboratories, and can be downloaded from:

http://www.statnlp.org/paper/malwaretextdb-a-database-for-annotated-malware-articles.html

The files in directory data/ann+brown contain the following annotations:

- Entity tags
- POS tags (obtained from Stanford's POSTagger)
- the Brown cluster

Remark
------

This corpus is interesting in that entities are labeled (in IOB2 format) with
"Entity" (no entity types are indicated). There are also labels for Verb and
Preposition.

NOTE: looking at entity "Regin", in Regis_The_Intercept.txtcbn, it seems that
the annotation is inconsistent.
